This week we took an exam and in it I liked one question which was #2 it clearly showed the outermost function so it was pretty easy too solve but it interested me that in the test for version 2 not that many people answered the same question as number 1.
This exam was pretty easy but at the same time difficult as most of the questions were either a novice or a professional. Overall in the end I saw my strengths and weaknesses in the subject also this test is gonna help me learn from my mistakes.
