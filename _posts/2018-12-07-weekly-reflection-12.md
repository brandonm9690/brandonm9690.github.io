So in this week we were doing flag geometry and I found that the layers part was the most frustrating. Also the lack of proper colors for the flag was also frustrating since ther shoul have been enough paper. If I had to start from scratch I would do what I did from the start and then continue with layers since I started to get accustomed to it. 
Either way this week was alright as all we did was concentrated on flags.
